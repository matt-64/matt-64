Hi there,

I am a developer with a passion for data, technology, and music. Over the past two years, I have undergone a career change and completed training in web development (PHP) and artificial intelligence at SIMPLON school in Bayonne. On my GitHub page, you will find examples of my work in these fields, as well as my interests in acoustics and electronic music. I look forward to collaborating with others and sharing my knowledge with the GitHub community.
